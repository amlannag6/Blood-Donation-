# Blood Wave
# Description
It happens in every 2 seconds, a person needs blood to survive from the surgery, cancer treatment, or a traumatic injury. Time is a key component in the medical field. One time consumed is another life lost.
An app that will assist people to get connected with the blood donor.  It would be a big asset for the people who need urgent blood, even rare types of blood. People who want to donate blood can create a donor Profile which will consist of essential info about the donor. The profile info will include the donor name, address and contact details and blood group so it can be easier for the recipients to contact the blood donors at the time of need with ease. Recipients can search the donor by blood Group.
The aim is to connect donors with patients that urgently need it on the go. A mobile application will make that happen. The design will be made for the donor's perspective.  This app will be easy to use and user-friendly to ease the process of getting blood from a donor in a short time. In a future update, the app will redirect by using GPS and the nearest hospital facilities.

# User Stories:

The Blood Wave app will be used for users that seek or want to donate blood to someone who is urgently looking for help. What I have found out through research is that we think that there is not problem with blood donation but there is actually a huge gap in people donating their blood there have been many cases where an individual with a rare blood type can not find the same blood type from their local hospital by using the app you can find people all over with that same blood because the hospitals database only has the people that have been registered to that specific hospital but if we use an app we can increase the users and donors so we do not have to go through the struggle of not finding the same blood type individual. This blood donation app will make it easier for people to track their blood donations and find a nearby blood donor and have direct communication with their donor. Due to the pandemic everything is rather now going online so the more we use the online resources the better it will be for the community. Blood being highly perishable, we insist that it should be stored in the best vessel , the human body! I think people do not want to just give their blood to random people. Another main factor we focused on this app is having the donor history a working function so users can see what they have requested and the entire history. In addition,In this app we are thinking about adding a description of the user so the blood donor can pick if they want to give it to that specific person. Overall, anyone using this app will be doing it for a good cause or so to help someone that is in need.
